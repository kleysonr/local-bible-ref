## Basics

### Inspiration

This plugin takes heavy inspiration from the [Bible Reference](https://github.com/tim-hub/obsidian-bible-reference) and [Bible Linker](https://github.com/kuchejak/obsidian-bible-linker-plugin) plugins - please check them out! I've been using the _Bible Reference_ plugin for a while (which has been great) and I love the simplicity of referencing passages using the `--` prefix. I also loved the idea of storing a Bible locally because then I can reference Bible passages even when I'm offline, as well as use my vault Bible for reading. Unfortunately, the markdown format of the _Bible Linker_ local Bible is not great for reading, and I prefer the simplicity of using the `--` prefix to fetch Bible passages. There's also some referencing limitations in the _Bible Reference_ plugin and occasionally some odd additions to passages returned from the [Boll's Life](https://bolls.life/) API. So, this is an amalgamation of those two plugins.

### Getting Started

To start with, you will need to format a Bible for your own vault.

If you would like to use your vault Bible for reading, I would encourage you to format it in the original _Local Bible Ref_ format. Some instructions on this can be found [below](#bible-markdown-format). I've also already formatted the Public Domain World English Bible so you can [download](https://github.com/camelChief/markdown-webp) that and just get started. If you don't want to go to all that hassle, you can use your existing _Bible Linker_ Bible with this plugin! In order to do that, simply select "Bible Linker" as your Bible format in the _Local Bible Ref_ settings.

Once you've done that, open up the _Local Bible Ref_ settings and fill in at least the _Bibles path_ field. Then, to use the plugin, simply open a new note and use the `--` reference prefix to grab a passage of scripture. There are also additional options (similar to terminal command options) you can provide to the reference to indicate which version to use and what markdown format to display the passage in. More information can be found [below](#usage).

## Usage

### References

In order to fetch a Bible passage, simply type in a Bible reference prefixed with `--`: `--John 1:1`. _Local Bible Ref_ currently supports Bible references in the form:

- Single verse: `--gen1:1`
- Multi verse: `--gen1:1-3`
- Single chapter: `--gen1`
- Multi chapter: `--gen1-3`
- Multi chapter & verse: `--gen1:3-3:9`

The referencing syntax also allows for a lot of flexibility:

- Short and full name references: `--gen1` + `--genesis1`
- Lowercase, uppercase and mixed-case references: `--gEnEsis1`
- Spacing (not more than a single space): `-- Genesis 1:1 - 2:2`
- Colon or comma chapter-verse separator: `--John 1:1` + `--John 1,1`

### Options

_Local Bible Ref_ also allows you to provide a few options to a reference to specify which version you would like to use as well as what markdown format to use. Add an option to a reference by adding a `+` followed by the option (in any order): `--gen1:1-5+esv`

You can also pass multiple options by simply chaining them: `-- John 1:1 +quote +esv`

Syntax: `--<reference>[+<option>]...`

## Bible Markdown Format

The Bible markdown format required for this plugin is slightly more complex than the format used for the _Bible Linker_ plugin. I chose this particular format because it makes the Bible much nicer to read if you simply wanted to use your vault Bible for reading (as I do). It looks something like this:

![localBibleRef2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5fc4ca1-bc9d-4fbb-b20c-e94c693d0660)

Most of the formatting shown here is unnecessary. You really only need to ensure your Bible adheres to the following:

- Verses are denoted by the verse number wrapped in the `sup` tag: `<sup>1</sup>`
- Each chapter is a markdown file of it's own
- Chapters are named with the convention `<book name> <chapter>.md`: `Genesis 1.md`
- Chapters are grouped into folders with the full name of the book: `Genesis`
- Books are grouped into a folder with the version code of the Bible: `CSB`
- All versions are under the same folder

Doing things this way allows you to store and reference multiple different versions of the Bible:

Beyond that, everything else (section headings, footnotes, links) is optional. Be careful not to add odd characters or extra text in the verses, or they will show up when you reference them. Currently, referencing will ignore YAML frontmatter, headings, chapter numbers (any bolded digits), footnotes and anything after a [horizontal rule](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Basic+formatting+syntax#Horizontal+rule).

If all of this seems a bit confusing, please check out the aforementioned [markdown formatted WEB](https://github.com/camelChief/markdown-webp) to help you understand the formatting requirements.

## Limitations

- Referencing does not yet support multiple passages: `Genesis 1:1; John 1:1`
